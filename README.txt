This is an extension for firefox (developed for v83) that downloads Ebooks from sites in blogpost format.
For a more detailed description and security warnings, see Description.txt. For license see LICENSE.

To use this extension, add it as a temporary extension to firefox.
Pick each of the three fields in the popup - click on the desired button, and then click on the relevant element in the webpage.
The element will chage color to show that it is picked. If you are not happy with your pick, click the same button and pick again.
For picking text body it is useful to click between paragraphs, and for picking the link to the next chapter either holding down Ctrl or clicking next to the link is useful.
After all fields are picked correctly, click download. The program will download the content to you download folders, in a subdirectory named the same as the domain name of the site you're downloading from.
